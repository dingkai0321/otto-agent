    Contributors add skills to `skills/` at the repo root: that is what

    the wheel only packages the `otto/` directory, so a `pip install otto-agent`
    would have found nothing there and silently started with zero skills —
    procedural memory, one of the four pillars, quietly missing. (It did, until
    2026-07-31.) pyproject force-includes the same folder into the wheel at
    `otto/skills`, so an installed Otto finds it next to the code.

    Exactly one of these exists at a time — the package copy only in a built
    wheel, the repo copy only in a checkout — so returning both is not a
    double-load, it is "wherever you installed from, the skills came too".
