"""`python -m otto gather` — the morning briefing, run as a graph.

    30 7 * * *  cd ~/otto-agent && make gather

This is the ONE place where real callables meet the pure workflow in
otto/graph/workflows/gather.py. Both the CLI and the dashboard's
/api/graph/stream come through build_bound_graph, so there is exactly one
definition of what a gather is allowed to touch — and a reviewer only has to
read one function to know.

Compare `brief.py` next door, which is the same job done as a LOOP: one prompt
in, the model decides which tools to call, four sequential round trips. Both
ship. Reading them side by side is the point.

Nothing here can act. The scans are reads, the synthesis is one model call with
no tools, and the only write is a markdown file in the outbox. See rule 1 in
the workflow's docstring.
